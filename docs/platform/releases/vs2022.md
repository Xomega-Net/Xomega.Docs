# Xomega.Net for VS 2022

Below is a summary of the release notes for the *Xomega.Net for Visual Studio 2022* releases.

## Version 9.12.2

Release Date: 06/30/2024

### New features

- **Support for PostgreSQL database.**
  - Added [`Database` selection](../../visual-studio/new-projects/new-solutions#reviewing-solution-configuration) with SQL Server and PostgreSQL options to the solution wizard under the `Service Implementations` project.
  - Updated project templates to support PostgreSQL for EF Core only.
  - Added PostgreSQL specific types and type configs to the model project as needed.
  - Added support for importing PostgreSQL enums and domain types.
  - Added ability to specify Postgres type (`pg-type`) for a SQL type config and import it from the DB for enums and domain types.
  - Updated [Database Schema](../../generators/data/schema) and [Database Change Script](../../generators/data/migration) generators to support PostgreSQL.

- **[Standard VS connection dialog](../../visual-studio/model-project/configuring-generators#configuring-connection-info)** is now used instead of the custom OLE DB connection dialog.
  - Command timeout is now specified in the connection string properties.
  - [Resetting connection info](../../visual-studio/model-project/configuring-generators#resetting-connection-info) is now done via a selection in a new `DB Provider` property.
  - Note: using standard VS connection dialog *removed ability to exclude tables to import* for now.

- **Support for [list types](../../visual-studio/modeling/types#list-types)**, backed by multi-database support of arrays in EF Core 8.x.
  - Type's `xfk:property` can be now configured as `multi-value` for array-based logical types.

### Minor changes

- DB connection string stored in the model project is now encrypted for security.
- `CamelCase`, `lower_case` and `UPPER_CASE` have been renamed in generators' properties to `PascalCase`, `lower_snake` and `UPPER_SNAKE` respectively.
- Configuration of cascade delete/update actions now includes the [`restrict` value](../../visual-studio/modeling/domain#foreign-key-configuration).
- SQL Server types and configs are now in separate model files that are excluded for non-SQL Server databases.
- [Database Schema](../../generators/data/schema#generator-parameters) and [Database Change Script](../../generators/data/migration#generator-parameters) generators now have a `Rerunnable` parameter to allow controlling wether the generated scrips are rerunnable. The new parameter is set to `false` by default for cleaner scripts.
- [Database Change Script](../../generators/data/migration) has been refactored to simplify generated scripts.
- Updated [Import from Database](../../generators/model/import) generator to handle FKs with different types than the referenced PKs.
- Excluded `edm_config.xom` if *Model.Diagrams* project is not selected in the new solution wizard.
- Excluded user controls in `global_config.xom` if *Client.Web* project is not selected in the new solution wizard.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed generators to allow using `sql:type` specified in the `type-config` elements.
- Fixed the issue with needing to open .xom files twice initially to get the Xomega editor.
- Fixed text of the grouping `NavMenu` for views defined without a module by using "Views" as the default resource.
- Fixed [Import from Database](../../generators/model/import) generator to not use a serial key on a subobject with a PK that includes parent keys.

## Version 9.12.1

Release Date: 03/27/2024

### New features
- Added support for **Entity Model Diagrams** as a separate project in a new solution.
- Updated [Entity Data Model generator](../../generators/data/edm) to clean up no longer valid entities and associations on the diagrams.

### Minor changes
- Added ability to [specify triggers](../../visual-studio/modeling/domain#object-configuration) under a `sql:table` config element in the model.
- Updated [EF Domain Objects generator](../../generators/data/entities) to configure entity table with triggers.
- Updated [Import from Database generator](../../generators/model/import) to import triggers from the database.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed [Import from Database generator](../../generators/model/import) to use generic types only (thus avoiding using the "user name" type as the base type).
- Fixed template for the `Model` project to exclude type configs that are not relevant to the selected solution configuration.
- Fixed project template for the `Client.Blazor.Wasm` project to use case-insensitive XML cache loader.

## Version 9.12.0

Release Date: 02/29/2024

### New features

- **Blazor moved to .NET 8 with support for various architectures.**
  - New Blazor solutions require .NET 8 now and are not backward compatible with previous .NET versions.
  - Xomega Solution wizard allows picking any Blazor architecture with different interactive render modes.
  - The main Blazor ASP.NET Core project allows enabling Blazor Server, hosted WebAssembly, or both with `Auto` mode.
  - The main Blazor project allows hosting REST API for the WebAssembly instead of running it as a separate project.
  - Blazor-hosted REST API uses a [path prefix](../../framework/services/api/rest#api-path-prefix) `api/` to not clash with Blazor view routes.
  - Blazor-hosted REST API for WebAssembly is secured with same-site cookie rather than JWT. 

- **New projects are now secured with a password login screen by default.**
  - New solution now includes an extensible model file `login.xom` in the Xomega model project.
  - `login.xom` is used to generate the `LoginView` with all the supporting objects and services.
  - New project also includes additional classes and customizations to support password login for the selected architectures.
  - The default password login implementation provides a 'Guest' login for ease of development.
  - Blazor `LoginView` is the same for Blazor Server and WebAssembly, despite different authentication mechanisms.
  - Blazor Server now allows to [revalidate authentication state](../../framework/services/security#revalidate) periodically.
  - REST API in the new solution implements either [cookie-based](../../framework/services/api/rest#cookie-authentication) or [JWT authentication](../../framework/services/api/rest#token-authentication), or both, as needed.
  - JWT authentication now provides support for [refresh tokens](../../framework/services/api/rest#refresh-tokens), in addition to short-lived access tokens.
  - Expired authentication now pops up a login screen for re-authentication.
  - Failed JWT token refresh will also display a ['Session expired'](../../framework/services/api/rest#client-jwt-authentication) warning on the login screen.
  - WPF apps with REST API use the new login view with JWT authentication.
  - WPF apps with WCF services now both use the new password `LoginView` and services by default.
  - TypeScript SPA apps use the new `LoginView` with JWT, but with no support for refresh tokens.
  - 2-tier WPF and legacy WebForms apps also use the new `LoginView` and services for password authentication.

- **Xomega model now allows you to specify an [authorization policy](../../visual-studio/modeling/presentation#security-policy) for each view.**
  - The specified authorization policy is automatically used on generated pages for Blazor views.
  - The specified policy is also used on the corresponding Blazor menu items of the generated main menu.

- **Cleaner projects' structures in the new solution.**
  - New solution now automatically sets up proper startup projects based on the selected configuration.
  - Projects in the new solution are now configured solely based on the selected configuration to reduce clutter.
  - There is no more conditional compilation code in the new projects, e.g. `EF6` vs `EFCore`.
  - The model project will now include only generators for the selected architectures.
  - Customization of the Blazor top menu is now performed in a separate class rather than the main `Program` class.
  - Defining Blazor authorization policies has been also moved from the main `Program` class to a separate class.
  - Configuring and securing REST API clients has been streamlined with the new [Xomega Framework 4.3.0](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

### Minor changes

- Updated dependencies of the new projects to the latest versions.
- Relaxed validation in the [Import from Database](../../generators/model/import#running-the-generator) generator to allow Xomega services without fields (e.g. `login.xom`).
- Added support for Bootstrap 5.3.2.
- [Syncfusion Blazor controls](../../framework/blazor/syncfusion/controls) now show validation errors under the control by default, rather than as a tooltip.
- Valid fields in [Xomega Blazor controls](../../framework/blazor/controls#specialized-input-types) no longer show a big green checkmark by default.
- Sidebar was updated to be toggled just by the Bootstrap, thus not requiring an interactive mode.
- Added default Blazor favicons.
- SPA project template now uses Nuget for TypeScript, instead of deprecated SDK.
- Added ability to mark an entire service as [not exposed for WCF](../../visual-studio/modeling/services#wcf-configuration) (e.g. login), updated WCF generators accordingly.
- Generators for WPF, SPA and WebForms views now use the [`field-cols`](../../visual-studio/modeling/presentation#ui-panel-layout) config for the number of columns, rather than the legacy [`ui:layout`](../../visual-studio/modeling/presentation#legacy-layout-config) config.
- New solution wizard now checks for a Xomega license before creating a solution.

### Bug fixes

- Generated data objects now better handle reads without blank keys, when Blazor activates blank models initially.


## Version 9.11.8

Release Date: 11/13/2023

### Minor changes

- Updated the `Dictionary` item template to add REST endpoint, make some fields required, and default the module to "Admin".
- Updated  [`Data Objects`](../../generators/presentation/common/data-objects) generator to make properties of supplied keys required and only check input of non-read operations for required properties.

### Bug fixes

- Added null check for inner properties to the generated [`Cache Loaders`](../../generators/enums/cache-loaders).
- Fixed generated [`Service Implementations`](../../generators/services/service-impl) to use the right `AddClause` method for criteria without operators.

## Version 9.11.7

Release Date: 6/21/2023

### Minor changes

- Project templates now use Xomega Framework 4.2.1 with several [enhancements and bug fixes.](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.2.1)
- Syncfusion resources are now loaded from the versioned Syncfusion package rather than from CDN to make upgrades easier.
- Updated the `Dictionary` item template to use `read enum` operation instead of `read`.
- Updated [`Data Objects`](../../generators/presentation/common/data-objects) generator to set `IsKey` on properties of objects with complex keys.
- Updated [`Model Operations`](../../generators/model/crud#read-list-operation) generator to generate `read list` criteria for object's keys, including composite keys.
- "*Trust Server Certificate*" parameter is now added to the [connection string](../../visual-studio/model-project/configuring-generators#database-parameters) for any SQL provider by default.
- NuGet packages on project templates were updated to the latest versions as appropriate.

### Bug fixes

- Xomega Framework 4.2.1 provides bug fixes for the Syncfusion grid version 21.2.9 and up.
- Fixed the [`Service Implementations`](../../generators/services/service-impl) generator for objects with complex keys.
- Fixed issue with loading Xomega Model projects in VS caused by unsupported default target framework v4.0.

## Version 9.11.6

Release Date: 1/14/2023

### New features

- Blazor and REST API project templates now target .NET 7 when it's installed.
- With .NET 7, the [generated Blazor pages](../../generators/presentation/blazor/views) now confirm unsaved changes when [navigating to another page or an external URL](../../framework/blazor/views#page-title-and-navigation-lock).
- The [generated Blazor pages](../../generators/presentation/blazor/views) now use the main view's title as the page title.
- Project templates now use Xomega Framework 4.2.0 with several [enhancements and bug fixes.](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.2.0)
