# Xomega.Net for VS 2022

Below is a summary of the release notes for the *Xomega.Net for Visual Studio 2022* releases.

## Version 9.12.0

Release Date: 02/29/2024

### New features

- **Blazor moved to .NET 8 with support for various architectures.**
  - New Blazor solutions require .NET 8 now and are not backward compatible with previous .NET versions.
  - Xomega Solution wizard allows picking any Blazor architecture with different interactive render modes.
  - The main Blazor ASP.NET Core project allows enabling Blazor Server, hosted WebAssembly, or both with `Auto` mode.
  - The main Blazor project allows hosting REST API for the WebAssembly instead of running it as a separate project.
  - Blazor-hosted REST API uses a [path prefix](../../framework/services/api/rest#api-path-prefix) `api/` to not clash with Blazor view routes.
  - Blazor-hosted REST API for WebAssembly is secured with same-site cookie rather than JWT. 

- **New projects are now secured with a password login screen by default.**
  - New solution now includes an extensible model file `login.xom` in the Xomega model project.
  - `login.xom` is used to generate the `LoginView` with all the supporting objects and services.
  - New project also includes additional classes and customizations to support password login for the selected architectures.
  - The default password login implementation provides a 'Guest' login for ease of development.
  - Blazor `LoginView` is the same for Blazor Server and WebAssembly, despite different authentication mechanisms.
  - Blazor Server now allows to [revalidate authentication state](../../framework/services/security#revalidate) periodically.
  - REST API in the new solution implements either [cookie-based](../../framework/services/api/rest#cookie-authentication) or [JWT authentication](../../framework/services/api/rest#token-authentication), or both, as needed.
  - JWT authentication now provides support for [refresh tokens](../../framework/services/api/rest#refresh-tokens), in addition to short-lived access tokens.
  - Expired authentication now pops up a login screen for re-authentication.
  - Failed JWT token refresh will also display a ['Session expired'](../../framework/services/api/rest#client-jwt-authentication) warning on the login screen.
  - WPF apps with REST API use the new login view with JWT authentication.
  - WPF apps with WCF services now both use the new password `LoginView` and services by default.
  - TypeScript SPA apps use the new `LoginView` with JWT, but with no support for refresh tokens.
  - 2-tier WPF and legacy WebForms apps also use the new `LoginView` and services for password authentication.

- **Xomega model now allows you to specify an authorization policy for each view.**
  - The specified authorization policy is automatically used on generated pages for Blazor views.
  - The specified policy is also used on the corresponding Blazor menu items of the generated main menu.

- **Cleaner projects' structures in the new solution.**
  - New solution now automatically sets up proper startup projects based on the selected configuration.
  - Projects in the new solution are now configured solely based on the selected configuration to reduce clutter.
  - There is no more conditional compilation code in the new projects, e.g. `EF6` vs `EFCore`.
  - The model project will now include only generators for the selected architectures.
  - Customization of the Blazor top menu is now performed in a separate class rather than the main `Program` class.
  - Defining Blazor authorization policies has been also moved from the main `Program` class to a separate class.
  - Configuring and securing REST API clients has been streamlined with the new [Xomega Framework 4.3.0](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

### Minor changes

- Updated dependencies of the new projects to the latest versions.
- Relaxed validation in the [Import from Database](../../generators/model/import#running-the-generator) generator to allow Xomega services without fields (e.g. `login.xom`).
- Added support for Bootstrap 5.3.2.
- [Syncfusion Blazor controls](../../framework/blazor/syncfusion/controls) now show validation errors under the control by default, rather than as a tooltip.
- Valid fields in [Xomega Blazor controls](../../framework/blazor/controls#specialized-input-types) no longer show a big green checkmark by default.
- Sidebar was updated to be toggled just by the Bootstrap, thus not requiring an interactive mode.
- Added default Blazor favicons.
- SPA project template now uses Nuget for TypeScript, instead of deprecated SDK.
- Added ability to mark an entire service as [not exposed for WCF](../../visual-studio/modeling/services#wcf-configuration) (e.g. login), updated WCF generators accordingly.
- Generators for WPF, SPA and WebForms views now use the [`field-cols`](../../visual-studio/modeling/presentation#ui-panel-layout) config for the number of columns, rather than the legacy [`ui:layout`](../../visual-studio/modeling/presentation#legacy-layout-config) config.
- New solution wizard now checks for a Xomega license before creating a solution.

### Bug fixes

- Generated data objects now better handle reads without blank keys, when Blazor activates blank models initially.


## Version 9.11.8

Release Date: 11/13/2023

### Minor changes

- Updated the `Dictionary` item template to add REST endpoint, make some fields required, and default the module to "Admin".
- Updated  [`Data Objects`](../../generators/presentation/common/data-objects) generator to make properties of supplied keys required and only check input of non-read operations for required properties.

### Bug fixes

- Added null check for inner properties to the generated [`Cache Loaders`](../../generators/enums/cache-loaders).
- Fixed generated [`Service Implementations`](../../generators/services/service-impl) to use the right `AddClause` method for criteria without operators.

## Version 9.11.7

Release Date: 6/21/2023

### Minor changes

- Project templates now use Xomega Framework 4.2.1 with several [enhancements and bug fixes.](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.2.1)
- Syncfusion resources are now loaded from the versioned Syncfusion package rather than from CDN to make upgrades easier.
- Updated the `Dictionary` item template to use `read enum` operation instead of `read`.
- Updated [`Data Objects`](../../generators/presentation/common/data-objects) generator to set `IsKey` on properties of objects with complex keys.
- Updated [`Model Operations`](../../generators/model/crud#read-list-operation) generator to generate `read list` criteria for object's keys, including composite keys.
- "*Trust Server Certificate*" parameter is now added to the [connection string](../../visual-studio/model-project/configuring-generators#database-parameters) for any SQL provider by default.
- NuGet packages on project templates were updated to the latest versions as appropriate.

### Bug fixes

- Xomega Framework 4.2.1 provides bug fixes for the Syncfusion grid version 21.2.9 and up.
- Fixed the [`Service Implementations`](../../generators/services/service-impl) generator for objects with complex keys.
- Fixed issue with loading Xomega Model projects in VS caused by unsupported default target framework v4.0.

## Version 9.11.6

Release Date: 1/14/2023

### New features

- Blazor and REST API project templates now target .NET 7 when it's installed.
- With .NET 7, the [generated Blazor pages](../../generators/presentation/blazor/views) now confirm unsaved changes when [navigating to another page or an external URL](../../framework/blazor/views#page-title-and-navigation-lock).
- The [generated Blazor pages](../../generators/presentation/blazor/views) now use the main view's title as the page title.
- Project templates now use Xomega Framework 4.2.0 with several [enhancements and bug fixes.](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework/releases/tag/v4.2.0)
- In addition to a sidebar, the [`NavMenu`](../../framework/blazor/components#navmenu) component can be now displayed as a top-level drop-down menu.

### Bug fixes

- Xomega Framework 4.2.0 provides bug fixes for using Syncfusion Blazor controls ver. 20.3.0.47.

### Minor changes

- Startup code in the web project templates is simplified to use a single top-level `Program` class.
- Cleaned up the CSS files in the Blazor projects using CSS isolation.
- The generated context for the [EF Domain Objects](../../generators/data/entities) now uses lazy loading for EF6.
- Added "*Trust Server Certificate*" to the connection string as a workaround for expired `SQLNCLI11` driver.
