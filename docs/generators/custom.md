# Custom Generators

In addition to the standard generators, the Full Edition of Xomega.Net allows you to develop your own XSLT-based generators and seamlessly integrate them into your object model project. The list of potential custom generators can possibly include, but is not limited to:

- Support of your choice of the ORM framework for the business layer, e.g. NHibernate.
- Documentation in a format of your choice, e.g. HTML, PDF, etc.
- Automated tests support for the object model.

Xomega technology lets you extend the default model structure to support your custom generators.

For example, to support your custom documentation generator you can define and use your own format for the model elements documentation, such as a markdown or HTML format.
