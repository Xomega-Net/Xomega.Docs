# 3. Modeling the details view

So far we have generated basic search and details views from a Xomega model that we imported from a database, and then configured our model further to generate a more useful and relevant search screen. Along the way, we have learned a lot of important Xomega concepts and methods, such as how to customize the generated code, define static and dynamic enumerations, and so forth, which, going forward, we will apply to other things in our tutorial.

Now, let's transform the sales order details form into a more usable screen using both techniques that we have already learned, and some new ones that are more pertinent to the details screens.
