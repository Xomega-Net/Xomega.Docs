# Next steps

In this tutorial you have seen how to use Xomega model driven development platform to quickly and easily build fully fledged desktop and web applications using a range of technologies - both modern Blazor, WPF or SPA with REST services and legacy ASP.NET WebForms or WCF services.

We have covered a great number of typical use cases and scenarios for advanced Search and Details views, which should help you get started with your own projects. Remember that the source for the example AdventureWorks applications that we have built in this tutorial are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/Xomega.Examples), and you can always run it, or use it as a reference.

You saw how flexible and customizable Xomega platform is. But it is also extremely extensible, allowing you to add custom model elements, modify existing generators, and even write your own generators to produce an architecture that is tailored to your own needs.

As you start using Xomega in your own projects, you can look at our How-To guides, as well as ask questions on our forum. Both Xomega Framework and XomegaJS are open source projects hosted on GitHub, so you can troubleshoot any issues with them using the original source code. We also welcome your help and contributions to these projects, such as documentation, bug fixes, or ideas for new features. And, of course, we would love to hear your feedback on our technology, framework and tutorials, so that we could make it even better.
