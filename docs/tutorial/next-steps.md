In this tutorial, you have seen how to use Xomega model-driven low-code development platform to quickly and easily build fully-fledged data-driven Blazor applications for both Blazor Server and WebAssembly with REST services.

We have covered a great number of typical use cases and scenarios for advanced Search and Details views, which should help you get started with your own projects. Remember that the source for the example *AdventureWorks* applications that we have built in this tutorial is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/Xomega.Tutorial), and you can always run it, or use it as a reference.

You saw how flexible and customizable the Xomega platform is. It is also extremely extensible, allowing you to add custom model elements, modify existing generators, and even write your generators to produce an architecture that is tailored to your own needs.

As you start using Xomega in your projects, you can look at our documentation, as well as [ask questions in our discussion board](https://xomega.net/about/contactus?fwd=https://github.com/Xomega-Net/Xomega.Net4VS/discussions). Both Xomega Framework and XomegaJS are open-source projects hosted on GitHub, so you can troubleshoot any issues with them using the source code.

We also welcome your help and contributions to these projects, such as documentation, bug fixes, or ideas for new features. And, of course, we would love to hear your feedback on our technology, framework, and tutorials, so that we could make it even better.
