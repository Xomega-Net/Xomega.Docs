# 1. Basic search/details views

As a first step, we will create a new Xomega solution configured to support both Blazor Server and WebAssembly target architectures, so that we could see how to generate either type of application with Xomega.

After that, we will import our model from the sample database, add CRUD operations and search/details views based on these operations to the model, and finally will generate end-to-end application code for our services and UI views.
